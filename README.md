SlimSharp
=========

A lightweight C# IDE and Compiler

Introduction
============

The inspiration for this project came from my enjoyment of the Visual Studio IDE 
as a programming environment for the C# language. However, after a long time of use,
I realized how big and bulking installing the IDE is and how slow it can be at times.
I was also looking for a big project to undertake in my free time. I chose to build a 
slimmer but similar IDE for the C# language.
